# godot-utilities
A collection of Godot utility scripts that simplify common game code patterns.

Scripts are categorized in four folders:
- Additions are instantiatable objects with internal logic that the base engine does not offer.
- DataObjects are instantiatable objects that manage data fields and usually offer signals to connect data to e.g. UI.
- Extensions are instantiatable extended built-in objects that facilitate their usage.
- Static are static classes with utility functions for various goals.
