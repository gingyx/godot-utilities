# godot-utilities
A library of Godot utility scripts that simplify common game code patterns.

Scripts are seperated into four folders, according to the following categories.

## Additions
Non-static objects with internal logic that the base engine does not offer.
## DataObjects
Non-static objects that manage data fields and usually offer signals to connect data to e.g. UI.
## Extensions
Extended built-in engine objects with functionality to facilitate their usage.
## Static
Static classes with utility functions by purpose.
